    "## Objective:\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to demonstrate understanding of the Gram-Schimdt process by explaining it to the computer.  Below there are three functions for you to complete:\n",
    "1. `normalize` takes a vector as input and returns the normalized verion of the vector.\n",
    "2. `project` takes two vectors as input and returns the projection of the first onto the second.\n",
    "3. `GramSchmidt` takes in a list of vestors, runs them through the Gram-Schmidt process and returns the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I understand that there alrteady exist built in functions to do this, the objective is not to get an answer it is to demonstrate that you can explain how to get the answer.  In each of the function there are steps where you are asked to use try and except commands to catch errors.  If you are not already familar with these then you should first complete the lab that runs through there basic usage."
