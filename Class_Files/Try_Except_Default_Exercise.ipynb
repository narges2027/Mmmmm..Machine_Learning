    "## Objectives:\n",
    "The objective of this lab is to gain a very basic understanding of how to use the try and except commands in Python to catch errors without bringing a program to a complete halt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below there are definitions for a new addition command `new_sum` and a new product command `new_prod` both of which will give errors if they are not given the correct inputs.  After these there is a filled in example of a variation on the sum command, `new_sum2`, which has uses the try and except commands to check that the inputs are of the correct type and to give a more meaningful error if they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your assignment is to read through these examples carefully to get an idea of how this works.  In particular play around with the difference in outputs from the testing block below when you try using `new_sum`, `new_prod`, or `new_sum2`.  Then dempnstrate that you understand the basiscs by filling in the `new_prod2` command so that it functions like the `new_sum2` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **extra credit**, play around with the two commands and try and find the following:\n",
    "1. Find and integer $n$ such that `new_sum2(a,n)` returns $a$ for all integers $a$. The value $n$ is called the additive identity.\n",
    "2. Find and integer $m_a$ such that `new_sum2(a,ma)` returns $n$ from the previous question; $m_a$ will depend on $a$.  The value $m_a$ is called the additive inverse of $a$\n",
    "3. Find and integer $k$ such that `new_prod2(a,k)` returns a for all integers a. The value $k$ is called the multiplicative identity."
