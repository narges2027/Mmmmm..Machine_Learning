# Multivariable Mathematics for Machine Learning and Jupyter Notebooks

This repository will support a Multivariable Mathematics for Machine learning class.  The primary objective is to house [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that give basic examples of how to use Python in a Jupyter Notebook to carry out the computations covered in the course.  In particular covering:
- Basic Vector and Matrix Computations
- Inner Products and Norms
- Orthogonalization Techniques
- Least Squares Regression
- Symmetric Matrices, Quadratic Forms, and Constrained Optimization
- Singular Value Decomposition and Principle Component Analysis
- Basic Calculus Computations
- Gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians
- Tangent Planes and Taylor Polynomials
- Gradient Descent
In the process we will be using [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  It will also be helpful to learn some basic [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and $\LaTeX$ since these are used to add text comments to the Jupyter Notebooks (or to files like this ReadMe).

All the basic files in this respoitory come from the [Jupyter Codespaces Template](https://github.com/github/codespaces-jupyter).  Copying this template is a useful way to create new repositories or codespaces when you want to work with Jupyter Notebooks but not fiddle with the details.

Demonstration file for the Multivariable Math class will be in a folder labelled Class_Files and any labs assigned will be in Lab_Files.  There will also be a folder for lecture notes as they are developed.
